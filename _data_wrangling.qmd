# **Data Wrangling**
***

If you have been following along but stopped, we could load our imported data like so:

```{r}
load(here::here("data", "imported", "pm25_data_imported.rda"))
```
***

<details> <summary> If you skipped the data import section click here. </summary>

An RDA version (stands for R data) of the data can be found [here](https://github.com//opencasestudies/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/tree/master/data/imported) or slightly more directly [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/master/data/imported/co2_data_imported.rda). Download this file and then place it in your current working directory within a subdirectory called "imported" within a directory called "data" to use the following code. We used an RStudio project and the [`here` package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) to navigate to the file more easily.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load(here::here("data", "imported", "co2_data_imported.rda"))
```

<!--
Use this section to explain step-by-step the data wrangling process used to prepare the data for analysis.

To allow users to skip import and wrangling we will save the data as an RDA file as well as a CSV file as this is often useful to send our data to collaborators. We will save this in a “wrangled” subdirectory of our “data” directory of our working directory.

```{r}
save(pm, file = here::here("data", "wrangled", "wrangled_data.rda"))
readr::write_csv(pm, file = here::here("data","wrangled", "wrangled_data.csv"))
```

<!--
Replace `pm` above with the name of the data object created at the end of data wrangling.
