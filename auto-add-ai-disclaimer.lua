 - Always validate the existence and relevance of suggested citations or packages
 -  Review, test, possibly simplify, and work to understand generated code or functions
 - Validate factual information using reliable sources</details> 
 -  Exercise extra caution with code in certain instances: code that installs packages, accesses or modifies files or data, uses credentials, or sends information over the internet

* [Disclose](https://aiattribution.github.io/) your AI use (including model and versions)
* Never provide sensitive data to a public AI tool. <details><summary>Examples</summary> Patient or student data, passwords, credentials, API keys, unpublished manuscripts or grants, and other proprietary code or internal documents.</details> 
* Be specific in your prompts and ask the chatbot and to help you understand the code
* The confidence of an AI tool does not indicate if its responses are correct. They may also agree with you when you are wrong.
* AI may respond differently to the same repeated prompt. Be sure to document what you can for the sake of reproducibility.
* Recognize that you may need to iteratively improve your prompt to reach the desired output.
