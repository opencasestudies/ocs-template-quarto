# **Data Import**
***

<!--
Describe how to import the case study data files into R or Python
-->

<!--
Within your case study project folder,
put the data files as they came from the source into a 'data/raw/' subfolder
and use the `here` package. See the following example and update with your data:
-->

```{r}
pm <-readr::read_csv(here("data", "raw", "pm25_data.csv"))
```

<!--
At the end of the data import section, save the imported data as .rda files
to allow users to stop and pick up where they left off:
-->

```{r}
save(pm, file = here::here("data", "imported", "pm25_data_imported.rda"))
```

<!--
NOTE that depending on the size of the data for Bio-OCS, the data may not be in the case study project folder directly
and may need to be imported from an external source
-->
