The purpose of the [Open Case Studies](https://opencasestudies.github.io){target="_blank"} project is **to demonstrate the use of various data science methods, tools, and software in the context of messy, real-world data**. A given case study does not cover all aspects of the research process, is not claiming to be the most appropriate way to analyze a given data set, and should not be used in the context of making policy decisions without external consultation from scientific experts. In addition, due to size constraints, datasets used within a case study may be subset of the original/full dataset.

<!--
UPDATE: ACCESS Information (github source and data)
In this space, provide an open access link to the case study source files.
This is necessary for users to get access to case study data, at a minimum.
See the following example from a previous case study (prior to Motivation section): https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/
-->

To access the GitHub repository for this case study see here: {LINK}

<!--
If the data isn't in the main github repository, be sure to describe and link to the open source location of the data and how to access it
-->

<!--
Include bioOCSdata package information once ready/applicable
-->

<!--
UPDATE: SYSTEM, SERVER, or MOCK COMPUTING Information:

In this space, provide any necessary system requirements or instructions on how to access a server (if necessary)
or submit a mock computing job within the learnr environment in order to receive pre-processed datasets (if necessary).
In essence this section is useful to provide information to learners on how to work with the data and follow along with this case study.
This section may not be needed for all case studies and can be removed if not
